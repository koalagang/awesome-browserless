# Web browsers suck
The modern web is slow and bloated. The traditional method of browsing with a graphical web browser is also. It is coated in malicious trackers and adverts. There are a few ways to go about solving this:
1. Use an alternative web protocol such as gopher or gemini - _these will likely never become mainstream_
2. Use a text-based browser such as lynx or w3m - _plenty of websites do not function well without JavaScript_
3. Use superior software where possible (see below) - _can be tinkered with an designed for its specific purpose_

# Superior software
Note that most of these applications are commandline-based but I have tried to include some GTK and Qt apps as well. I have tested anything with a tick ✅ next to it.

This is it for now but I will be adding more...

# If you must use a browser
Use one of the following:
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) (a private Chromium-based browser)
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/) (Firefox but entirely FOSS and with better defaults)
* [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) (a lightweight browser keyboard-driven browser)
* [Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/) (the oldest actively maintained text-based browser)
* [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) (a text-based browser which supports image viewing)

I would also suggest that you use [Surfraw](https://gitlab.com/surfraw/Surfraw/) and then aliasing your preferred search engine (e.g. alias ddg='sr duckduckgo') to make using text-based browsers more convienient and also [block trackers using your localhost file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPfpCVW7ZvM) or even [network level](https://pi-hole.net/).
