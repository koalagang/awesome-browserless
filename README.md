# Web browsers suck
The modern web is slow and bloated. The traditional method of browsing with a graphical web browser is also clunky. It is coated in malicious trackers and adverts. There are a few ways to go about solving this:
1. Use an alternative web protocol such as gopher or gemini - _these will likely never become mainstream_
2. Use a text-based browser such as lynx or w3m - _plenty of websites do not function well without JavaScript_
3. Use superior software where possible (see below) - _can be tinkered with and designed for its specific purpose_

# Superior software
NOTE: most of these tools are commandline-based because I prefer using the terminal but I have included a few graphical applications as well
* Basic searches: [Tuxi](https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi)

You can also add Reddit pages to your RSS feed.
* Documenation: [Man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) _or_ run '--help' at the end of a command _or_ - _TIP_: you can [use a different manpager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab3rY0X5kD4) if you don't like less

# If you must use a browser
Use one or more of the following:
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) (a private Chromium-based browser)
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/) (Firefox but entirely FOSS and with better defaults)
* [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) (a lightweight keyboard-driven browser)
* [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) (the most private browser in the world; powerful for countering government censorship)
* [Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/) (the oldest actively maintained text-based browser)
* [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) (a text-based browser which supports image viewing)
* [Amfora](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora) (a fancy terminal browser for the Gemini protocol)

I would also suggest that you use [Surfraw](https://gitlab.com/surfraw/Surfraw/) and then aliasing your preferred search engine (e.g. alias ddg='sr duckduckgo' or alias wp='sr wikipedia') to make using text-based browsers more convienient and also [block trackers using your local host file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPfpCVW7ZvM) or even [network level blocking](https://pi-hole.net/).
